# CRM with Google Sheets and Redash

Part of our #lowcode hacks, this project uses Google Sheets + Google Apps Script + Azure SQL Server + Redash for doing a doing a Customer Relationship Management (CRM).

## What we used
  - [Google Sheets](https://www.google.com/sheets/about/) - to control spreadhseets' creation and control access to those.
  - [Google Apps Script](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/) - to create the spreadsheet for all clients, send data to database and block alter data after sent.
  - [Azure SQL Server](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/sql-database/) - to store all the data in a centralize database to query.
  - [Redash](https://redash.io/) - to query and build dashboards from all spreadsheets data.
  
## How it works
